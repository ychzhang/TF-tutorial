# Tensorflow Tutor Code

This repo contains the tutor code for tensorflow beginners. The documentation is at [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16nMMqGOytPgfUZRUFAmBeR-Gec2_t_6DAsVRqhrJbFE/edit?usp=sharing).

The test environment is 
```
python 2.7.13
tensorflow 1.5.0
```
Clone or fork the code to your own machine. Type in
```
python mnist.py
```
It will automatically train the model and print out loss values and test accuracies. Feel free to change the code and play around with it.

Have fun!
